### License
These templates are protected under the [Eclipse Public 1.0 License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)

### Requirements
All Docker templates require the following  plug-ins for full integration capabilities:
[Docker Compose](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/docker-compose/)
[Docker](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/docker-2/)
[Docker Source Config](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/dockersourceconfig-ibmucd/)

### Docker Template
Summary: Our supported Docker Template used in our [Docker](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/2016/03/21/docker-deployments-for-the-enterprise/) and [Docker Compose](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/2016/11/23/docker-compose-deployments-enterprise/) blog posts. This template provides basic processes and configuration for public Docker images. Combined with the Docker Compose and Docker Application templates, these configurations demonstrate the best practices of Docker Compose deployments through UrbanCode Deploy. This template can also be found in our [Docker Automation plug-in](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/docker-2/).

### Docker Compose Template
Summary: This is our supported Docker Compose Template used in our [Docker Compose blog post](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/2016/11/23/docker-compose-deployments-enterprise/). Use this image to properly handle and deploy Docker images through a docker-compose.yml file. Combined with the Docker and Docker Application templates, these configurations demonstrate the best practices of Docker Compose deployments through UrbanCode Deploy.


### Docker ICS Template
Summary: The Docker ICS Template provides configuration and processes utilizing IBM Container Services. This template also requires the installation of the [Cloud Foundry IBM Containers plug-in](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugin/cloud-foundry-ibm-containers/).
